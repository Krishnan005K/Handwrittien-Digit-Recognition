# Handwritten Digit Recognition
The Handwritten Digit Recognition project is a web-based application that allows users to draw digits and recognize them using a trained machine learning model. It provides a canvas for users to draw digits, which are then processed by the model to make predictions.

# Features

Draw digits on a canvas.

Recognize handwritten digits using a machine learning model.

View predictions for drawn digits.


# Technologies Used

Python

Tkinter (for GUI)

TensorFlow (for machine learning model)

PIL (Pillow)


# How to Run


Clone the repository.

Install the required Python packages (pip install pillow tensorflow tkinter).

Run the application (python GUI.py).

# Usage

Draw a digit on the canvas.

Click the "Recognize" button to see the prediction made by the model.
